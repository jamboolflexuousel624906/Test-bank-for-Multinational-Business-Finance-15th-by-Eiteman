  * Renowned for its authoritative, comprehensive coverage of contemporary international finance, Multinational Business Finance trains the leaders of tomorrow’s multinational enterprises to recognize and capitalize on the unique characteristics of global markets. Because the job of a manager is to make financial decisions that increase a firm’s value, the authors have embedded real-world mini-cases throughout to apply chapter concepts to the types of situations managers of multinational firms face. The 15th Edition attempts to capture the rapid evolution of our global marketplace, taking a closer look at the types of organizations that permeate the widespread arena, competition and opportunities in emerging markets, and how financial leadership can integrate the strategic and financial challenges that global businesses face today.
